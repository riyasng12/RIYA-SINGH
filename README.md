# RIYA-SINGH
A little bit about me!

Hey! My name is Riya Singh and I'm a 4th year engineering student at KSSEM.
I'm also a core team member for GDSC-KSSEM.

I've been interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for a while and I'm learning my way around it. 

I'd love to work on more projects and learn more in the coming future!
